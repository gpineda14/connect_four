# Connect Four

I created a Connect Four game using TDD. I found it difficult to come up with tests for the program but I believe it helped with created more organized code and the tests helped me stay focus on the small objectives so it sped up my programming. I created the program as part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/testing-ruby)
